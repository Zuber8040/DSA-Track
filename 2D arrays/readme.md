2D Array

why 2D array =. if we have huge size of array then we can use 2d array 

Initiaze => 


int arr [1000][1000];

int=> datatype means what type of 2d array its
arr => name of 2d array 
first [1000]=> no of rows
second [1000]=> no of column 


Access => 
arr [index of row][index of column];

how it stored in the memory => 

formula => c*i+j
            c =no .of column in arr 
            i = ith row
            j = jth col 


input in 2d array
create 2 for loops 
cin>>arr[i][j];


imp =>index always range from n ->n-1 && 0-> m-1     n-> no of rows / m-> no of columns

why we need column bcoz it help to mapping in memory

int arr[row][colnm]


<!-- list of que -->

1. find some of all arrays 
2. find key present or not in 2d array 
3. find min/max in 2d array
4. tranpose matrix in 2d array


<!-- to practice -->
1. rotate matrix by 90
2. Spiral print
3. wave print /zig zag
4. median of 2D array
5. matrixx mutiplication


<!-- vector form in 2D array -->


vector<vector<int>>v;
vector=>outter vector
vector<int>=> inner vector
int => data type
v => name of vector



<!-- customiaz  -->


vector<vector<int>>arr(row size,vector<int>(4,0));
here vector<int>(4)=> means size of column ;
all the values will be assign with 0


home work => 
sort 0's and 1's one d array

movve -ve no to one side of array

find duplicate of an array

find missing ele in array

find first repeating in an element

find common elements in 3 arrays

find factorial of large number 

sprial print 

wave print
